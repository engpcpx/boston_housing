## Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Model Development:** Implement and train regression models, particularly decision tree regressors, to predict housing prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tune model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy and generalization.
